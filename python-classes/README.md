# Python - Classes and Objects

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School.  
It introduces the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, focusing on classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and properties.

The goal is to understand how OOP works in Python and how to properly structure and document code following the Holberton style guidelines.
