# Python - Data Structures: Lists & Tuples

This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher Level Programming** curriculum.  
It introduces two of the most fundamental data structures in Python: **lists** and **tuples**.  
You will learn how they work, when to use each one, and how to manipulate sequences effectively.
