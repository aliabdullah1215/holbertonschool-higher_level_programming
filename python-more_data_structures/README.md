# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher Level Programming** curriculum.  
It introduces two important Python data structures — **sets** and **dictionaries** — as well as functional programming tools such as **lambda**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**.
